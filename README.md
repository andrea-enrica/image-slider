This is a small project to create a simple image carousel. It contain arrows
on each side to advance the image forward or backward. It automatically move
forward every 5 seconds. It contain the little navigation circles at the
bottom that indicate whici slide you are on (its corresponding circle gets
filled in) and they are click-able to advance to that particular slide.
